    <p class="reviewStyle">Death Note is about a high school student named Light Yagami who finds a magical notebook that can kill anyone who’s name is written in it. He uses this power to kill criminals such as murderers and thieves. His main goal is to become God of “the new world”. This attracts the attention of the police and an investigator who goes only by the letter L. They want to find the person behind all these killings and bring them to justice. Light attempts to sabotage the investigation by attempting to find the identity of L and killing him using the notebook. It becomes a thrilling chess match between two highly intelligent individuals to expose the other. This is easily the best strategy anime ever made and a must watch for all anime fans
